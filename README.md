What it does: <br/>
    does PCA on the following variables:     HURS      HUSS          PSL         TAS        CLT        ZG500       VAS       UAS<br/>
    prints the explained variance as a percentage<br/>
    it does pca for 10 different random orders of variables<br/>
Output: 8Mar2021PCA1_output.txt<br/>
Conclusion: PCA is giving wildly different results solely based on the order, thus it cannot be relied on to give correct results.<br/>
