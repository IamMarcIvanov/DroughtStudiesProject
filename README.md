What it does: 
    does PCA on the following variables:     HURS      HUSS          PSL         TAS        CLT        ZG500       VAS       UAS
    prints the explained variance as a percentage
    it does pca for 10 different random orders of variables
Output: 8Mar2021PCA1_output.txt
Conclusion: PCA is giving wildly different results solely based on the order, thus it cannot be relied on to give correct results.
